## Hello, World! 👋 I'm Inês. ##


I'm an architect who has recently graduated from the [Web Development Bootcamp at Le Wagon](https://www.lewagon.com/web-development-course/full-time) in Amsterdam.
This experience gave me the opportunity to create apps that are fun to use and are written in code that's maintainable and easy to read.

Now I’m looking forward to working alongside developers and designers and broadening my knowledge on web development.

## How I can add value within your company 💪 ##

### Full Stack 🌈

As a developer, I enjoy the:

My working experience as an architect combined with the technical knowledge acquired at the bootcamp, makes me suitable for both Front- and Backend tasks.

### Fast Learner ⚡

Problem solving was always my motivation to keep on learning. Both, my

- [x] :construction_worker_woman: 6+ years of work experience including lauching my own architecture office and as an researcher assistant and teacher assistant

- [x]  📚extensive library at home 

classify me as a fast and passionate learner. But it was foremost through mentors and teamwork that I’ve grown personally and professionally.

**Hello, World! 👋 I'm Ines.**                                                                                                                                              

I'm an architect who has recently graduated from the [Web Development Bootcamp at Le Wagon] (https://www.lewagon.com/web-development-course/full-time) in Amsterdam.
This experience gave me the opportunity to create apps that are fun to use and are written in code that's maintainable and easy to read.

Now I’m looking forward to working alongside developers and designers and broadening my knowledge on web development.
